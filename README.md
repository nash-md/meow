## How to Install

This project is written in Typescript and split into two parts, the frontend written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) and the backend based on [Express](https://expressjs.com/). You find the React UI sources in `/frontend`, the server in `/backend`.

### Your own Server - Backend

In order to build the project make sure that you have Node.js v16+ and higher and Git installed.

Clone a copy into your local project directory.

`git clone https://github.com/nash-md/meow.git`

Change the directory to `/backend` and install the dependencies.

`npm install`

Build the project using

`npm run build`

Before you run the build, you’ll need to define the following variables for later use.

- `MONGODB_URI` - pointing to your MongoDB instance.
- `SESSION_SECRET` - a string used to hash the JWT sessons
- `PORT` - server port, if not set the server will use port `9000`
- `IP_ADDRESS` - the backend server address, default is `127.0.0.1`
- `LOG_LEVEL` - self-explanatory
- `NODE_ENV` - please set this value to `production` for a production build

In `production` mode the server will not allow any cross-origin requests.

Run the project with

`node build/worker.js`

If you want to load environment variables from a file, install dotenv package to handle local environment variables.

`npm install dotenv`

In the root directory create a file called `.env`, then add the following to top of worker.ts

```
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();
```

After the build, you will find the UI in the `/build` directory.

### Frontend

Change the directory to `/frontend` and install the dependencies.

`npm install`

Before building the React frontend, you'll need to set the following variables.

- `VITE_URL` this is the url the frontend will try to connect to, if not set it will try to connect to the backend on the same server on `/public` and `/api`.

This project was built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

`npm run build`

You will find the build artifacts in the `build` directory. Host the static files it on the server of your choice.

### Using Docker

Docker is a platform that allows you to easily create, deploy, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight and portable, providing an isolated environment that runs consistently across different systems. To install Docker follow this [guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

The root directory of this project contains a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml`, you can build and run it with.

`docker-compose up`

### Database Support

This project heavily depends on MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

While it is possible to replace MongoDB with another database, please note that due to the significant dependencies and specific optimizations tailored for MongoDB, such a migration might be challenging.

### Security

The Typescript backend is compiled with the following [CORS](https://github.com/expressjs/cors) setup, you can change it in `backend/worker.ts`

```
corsOptions: cors.CorsOptions = {
  origin: '*',
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'DELETE'],
};

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  corsOptions.origin = false;
}
```

Setting `origin` to `false` in production mode means that the server will not allow any cross-origin requests. This is a security measure that prevents unauthorized access to the server's resources from other domains. By default, when an origin is not allowed, the browser will return a 403 Forbidden response to the client.
